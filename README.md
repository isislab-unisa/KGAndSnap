# Knowledge Graphs And Snap

This project proposes the extention of [Snap!](https://snap.berkeley.edu) to create and run SELECT SPARQL queries on Knowledge Graphs. The extension is realized by the `KGObjects.js` module. The resulting platform KGsnap! is freely available onlinea at https://isislab-unisa.github.io/Snap/snap.html.

Examples of KGsnap! in use are reported in the `examples` folder.
